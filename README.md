# Smart-Home-HVAC-Control-
This project implements a low-power temperature monitoring system on an STM32 microcontroller using FreeRTOS with Tickless Idle mode. The system reads temperature data from an LM35 sensor, sends processed data to multiple FreeRTOS tasks, and controls a buzzer/LED based on threshold conditions.  

## Hardware Setup

Here is the hardware used in this project:
